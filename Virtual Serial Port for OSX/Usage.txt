WARNING - This kext MAY crash your computer unless you are a bit careful. Maybe even then.
************************  IT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS  *************************************

In order to use the kext you must do the following:

1. Remove System Integrity Protection
2. Build and load kernel extension
3. Build and run VSPTester (DCE)
4. Open up a Serial Tool or terminal (DTE)
4. Open up a connection to the kext with the DTE. It should appear as 'VirtualSerialPort'

After connecting, info about the connection will appear in the VSPTester window. You can send
data from the VSPTester and it will appear at the DTE. Unfortunately it doesn't yet work in the
other direction.


**** Remove System Integrity Protection *******************

To load an unsigned kext into a modern version of OSX you will have to remove the S.I.P
This varies with the operating system but for El Capitan:

// To check if enabled or disabled via terminal
$ csrutil status

// To enable or disable:
Click the  menu and select Restart...
Hold down command-R to boot into the Recovery System.
Click the Utilities menu and select Terminal.
Type csrutil disable or enable and press return.
Close the Terminal app.
Click the  menu and select Restart....


**** Load the kext ****************************************

Build this project, find VirtualSerialPort.kext product and move it to the desktop.
You can find the built kext by control-clicking on the built product and selecting
'Show in Finder'. Then, using the terminal (you will be asked for your password):

$ cd to your desktop
$ sudo cp -R VirtualSerialPort.kext /tmp - this is an easy way to set permissions
$ chown -R root:wheel /tmp/VirtualSerialPort.kext
$ sudo kextload /tmp/VirtualSerialPort.kext

There is an InstallVirtualSerialPort.sh script that does the above. To run it:
move script to desktop.

$ cd to your desktop
$ sh InstallVirtualSerialPort.sh


To Unload the driver:
$ sudo kextunload -b com.fracturedsoftware.VirtualSerialPort

To show all kexts:
$ kextstat

To show the endpoint
$ ls /dev/tty.*

The serial port should show up as cu.VirtualSerialPort and tty.VirtualSerialPort


**** Run VSPTester ***************************************

The included VSPTester app will open up a communication channel with the VirtualSerialPort via
the VSPUserClient. It will then show details of the Serial port settings as they change.
You can send some data from the tester to your DTE when it is connected. Unfortunately sending
data from the DTE to VSPTester doesn't work yet.


**** Open up a Serial Tool and connect to kext ************

You can use something like Serial Tools: http://www.w7ay.net/site/Applications/Serial%20Tools/Contents/download.html
or with the terminal:

> screen  /dev/tty.VirtualSerialPort 115200

If you are using the terminal disconnect by typing control-a followed by control-\.
