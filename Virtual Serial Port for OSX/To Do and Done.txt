This is very much a work in progress but very nearly 'working' for at least simple cases. If you follow
the Usage.txt instructions you should be able to send simple messages to your terminal from the VSPTester.

The main remaining problem is to figure out why text can't be sent the other way, say from the terminal
to the VSPTester. It may be a flow control problem or something else completely. Unfortunately, I am not
familiar enough with the details of serial port communication to figure out what is preventing data
flowing to the port. Whatever it is, VirtualSerialPort::enqueueData is never called. What does happen
though is each time a key is pressed a setState (TX_EVENT) is sent. This and other events can be seen by
opening the console as I have enabled logging for most methods.

The other bit that appears to work but may not be working correctly is that VirtualSerialPort::dequeueData
is called continuously - hundreds of times per second. I am not sure if this is correct or some state bit is
set incorrectly, causing dequeueData to be called all the time. I have switched off DEBUG_IOLOG for this method.
