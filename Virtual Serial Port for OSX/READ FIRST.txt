WARNING: - This project creates a kernel extension - kext - that MAY crash your computer unless
you are a bit careful. Maybe even then. IT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. It hasn't crashed for me for
a while though.

This is a semi working example of a virtual serial port for OSX. See Usage.txt for how to
experiment with it. See To Do.txt for what is working and what still needs to be done. The code
in VirtualSerialPort.cpp is based on code by:

Hiroki Mori. https://sourceforge.net/p/ubsa-osx/svn/13/tree/FTDIDriver/  (BSD License).

IMPORTANT:

1. Current operating systems won't let you load kexts that are not signed unless you remove
    the System Integrity Protection. See Usage.txt for further details

2. This project is not fully working. The VirtualSerialPort can send data from the VSPTester
    (DCE) to a connected Serial Tool (DTE). However it can't yet send data in the opposite
    direction.


WHAT IS THIS?:

A project to enable an emulated hardware device with a serial port (DCE) to communicate with a
standard serial tool (DTE) such as the terminal. The project has three components:

A kernel extension - kext - that creates a virtual serial port (VirtualSerialPort) that will
appear as a serial device in /dev and will be found by standard searches using IOServiceMatching
and IOServiceGetMatchingServices. The kext also has a user client (VSPUserClient) for
communicating with a app (eg. emulated hardware) that wants a serial port to show up in /dev.

A tester app that acts as a 'very' basic hardware device. The tester app communicates with the
VirtualSerialPort through a VSPUserClient that also resides in the kernel. Note that the tester
does not load the kext automatically, whereas a real app probably would.

So:

                                                                                  |
                   VSPTester (DCE)                                     /dev/tty.VirtualSerialPort
                         |                                                        |
